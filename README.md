This is a repository of all the programs and projects I have created or worked on at college as well as by myself.

CGPA CALCULATOR:

This is a Java Program that does the following related to Packages and Interfaces, Exception Handling:

a. Creates an interface Student which gets the name and branch of a student.

b. Creates a package called ‘StudentPackage’ which has a user-defined class
RegisterStudent.

c. If a student registers above 30 credits for the semester, throws a user-defined exception called ‘CreditLimit’ and displays an
appropriate message.

d. Creates another package called ‘ResultPackage’ which displays the grades for the subjects registered for that particular semester and the SGPA. If SGPA
is above 10 then it throws an InvalidSGPA user-defined exception.

e. In the StudentPackage, collects the marks of all the subjects in 4 semesters and calculate SGPA and CGPA.
